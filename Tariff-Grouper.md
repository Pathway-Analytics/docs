# Tariff Grouper

> The Tariff Grouper automates the implentation of tariffs for healthcare activity.

## Setup

To setup a Tariff arrangement you will need to have a tariff configuration, this is usually handled by the commissioner who is responsible for specifying the tariff details.  The participating providers and commissioners who need to accees the charging data will also user subscriptions.

### Tariff Configuration Setup

The process is usually started with an online meeting to discuss requirements.  We strongly recommned creating a tariff configuration from an existing configuration that is already managed and updated.

#### Tariff Configuration Service Fee

In addition to individual user subscriptions we raise a charge for each bespoke local tariff configuration.  This covers the setup, implementation and maintenance of a tariff configuration, including in-year changes and providing firat line support for questions raised about it and the data it produces from commissioners and providers.

### Subscriptions

Access to the Tariff Grouper service is online and accounts are offered by subscription. Contact enquiries@pathwayanalytics.com to request a subscription with the user name and email of each subscriber.  We will issue a quote, once that is accepted we will issue login credentials and an invoice.

#### Subscription Types

Each subscription is for a single user and associated with a single organisation (provider or commissioner).  Commissioner organisations are Local Authority Districts or Counties, Provider organisations are healthcare providers.

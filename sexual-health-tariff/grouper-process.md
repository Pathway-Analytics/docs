   - Develop the tariff configuration based on the discussions from the initial meeting. This should include all necessary details and specifications.

3. **Review and Approval**: 
   - Share the draft configuration with stakeholders for review. Collect feedback and make necessary adjustments.

4. **Implementation**: 
   - Once approved, implement the tariff configuration. Ensure that all participating providers are informed and have access to the necessary resources.

5. **Training and Support**: 
   - Provide training sessions for users on how to utilize the Tariff Grouper effectively. Offer ongoing support for any questions or issues that arise.

6. **Monitoring and Evaluation**:

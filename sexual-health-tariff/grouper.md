# Tariff Grouper

> The Tariff Grouper automates the implementation of tariffs for healthcare activity.

## Setup

To set up a Tariff arrangement, you will need to have a tariff configuration. This is usually handled by the commissioner who is responsible for specifying the tariff details. The participating providers and commissioners who need to access the charging data will also require subscriptions.

### Tariff Configuration Setup

The process is usually started with an online meeting to discuss requirements. We strongly recommend creating a tariff configuration from an existing configuration that is already managed and updated.

### Tariff Configuration Service Fee

In addition to individual user subscriptions, we raise a charge for each bespoke local tariff configuration. This covers the setup, implementation, and maintenance of a tariff configuration, including in-year changes and providing first-line support for questions raised about it and the data it produces from commissioners and providers.

### Subscriptions

Access to the Tariff Grouper service is online, and accounts are offered by subscription. Contact enquiries@pathwayanalytics.com to request a subscription with the username and email of each subscriber. We will issue a quote; once that is accepted, we will issue login credentials and an invoice.

#### Subscription Types

Each subscription is for a single user and associated with a single organization (provider or commissioner). Commissioner organizations are Local Authority Districts or Counties, while Provider organizations are healthcare providers.

- **Basic Provider**: Covers the activity delivered by the provider the subscription is associated with. Allows the subscriber to undertake basic activity data uploads and tariff calculations.
  
- **Provider+**: Covers the activity delivered by the provider the subscription is associated with. Allows the subscriber to undertake activity data uploads, tariff calculations, sandbox (test) calculations, KPI Reports, and more.
  
- **Commissioner**: Covers the charges raised by residents of the organization associated with the subscription and those charges raised by patients with no known address or from outside England and Wales who attend a clinic located within the organization associated with the subscription.
  
- **Additional Organizations**: Where a subscriber wants to cover a wider area, additional organizations can be included in the subscription. Either additional provider organizations in the case of a Provider subscription or additional Local Authority Districts in the case of a Commissioner subscription. We can also offer commissioners coverage of charges associated with a provider by adding a provider as an additional organization to their subscription.

### Subscription Period

Subscriptions are offered for 10 months; they are automatically extended to 12 months if payment is received within 30 days of our invoice.

### Subscription Transfers

We are happy to transfer subscriptions in the event of a new appointee, long-term sickness, and similar events.

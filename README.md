# Pathway Analytics Documentation

Welcome to the Pathway Analytics documentation site. This project provides comprehensive documentation for the Tariff Grouper and Tariff Configurations, aimed at healthcare providers and commissioners.

## Overview

The Pathway Analytics documentation site is built using Docsify, a dynamic documentation site generator that allows for easy navigation and a clean presentation of information. The site is designed to provide users with the necessary resources to understand and implement tariff arrangements effectively.
